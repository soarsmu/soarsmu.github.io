  <div class="col-sm-9"> 
  <p> Lingxiao Jiang is an Associate Professor of Information Systems at Singapore Management University. He worked as a test strategist at Nvidia for half a year before he joined the faculty of SCIS at SMU. He is broadly interested in the area of Software Engineering, Programming Languages, Systems, Security, and Data Mining. He has been spending substantial efforts on software mining, program analysis, code search & reuse, program comprehension & generation, aiming to provide practical techniques and tools for enhancing software reliability, increasing development productivity, reducing maintenance cost, and improving user experience. He received <a href="https://scis.smu.edu.sg/news/2018/nov/02/smu-researcher-wins-2018-acm-sigsoft-impact-paper-award">the 2018 ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award</a>. The annual award is presented to authors of papers published at least ten years ago that have been deemed highly influential by the international software engineering community.
  A general theme of his work is mining and analysis for software engineering, such as detection of code clones, code query processing, detection of bugs, search for bug fixes, deep learning of code, and search for better testing & debugging techniques. The search is being carried out on various contextual data sources in addition to program code itself, such as code change histories, program bug databases, test suites, developer activities, user feedbacks, and socio-technical information pertaining to the complex interactions between people and technologies in both software development processes and real-world usage scenarios. To enable the extraction of information from various data sources and to enable efficient search and analysis, various technologies are being employed, such as static & dynamic program analysis, software engineering methodologies, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing, and distributed computing techniques. </p>
